                    <p> Looking for opportunities to learn everyday! </p>
                    <p> I've never been naturally gifted at many things, especially maths or sciences. As much as I loved computers when I was younger, my lack of STEM ability made me reluctant to consider a career in programming. </p> <p>
                        My issue was I thought if something didn't come naturally to me, I could never be good at it, I could never achieve anything in that area. 
                    </p> <p>
                        Programming, although it was and continues to be the most difficult mental challenge I've encountered, taught me that it's OK to struggle. 
                    </p> <p>
                        Even when it doesn't come after one hour, or one day, or even one week, you can learn something from the problem you are trying to solve. And, it feels even better when you get it than solving a problem in a subject that comes easily to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm coding, programming, reading and learning everyday. Progress is slow, but that's OK :)
